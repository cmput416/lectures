\section{Key Takeaways}

A \emph{poset} is a set with a notion of ``less than or equal''.

A \emph{lattice} is a poset which comes equipped with:
\begin{itemize}
\item a binary operator which computes the least upper bound of any two elements called the \emph{join} $\sqcup$,
\item a binary operator which computes the greatest lower bound of any two elements called the \emph{meet} $\sqcap$.
\end{itemize}

If only one of the operators are defined, then the poset is a \emph{semi-lattice}.

A \emph{complete lattice} is a lattice where the meet and join operators can be applied to arbitrary subsets of the lattice.

A \emph{bounded lattice} is a lattice comes equipped with:
\begin{itemize}
\item a top element $\top$, with $x \sqle{} \top$ for all $x$,
\item a bottom element $\bot$, with $\bot \sqle{} x$ for all $x$.
\end{itemize}

A \emph{chain} is a totally ordered subset of the lattice.

The \emph{height} of the lattice is the size of the longest chain.
